_Write answer here (~3-4 sentences)_

## 2. Genome browser view
Take a screenshot of your genome browser and add it to your git repository in the same folder as this markdown file. Display it below using `![alt text](Image.png "Title")`. How many exons does the gene have? What strand is it on? What other information is annotated - is the function description accurate and complete?
